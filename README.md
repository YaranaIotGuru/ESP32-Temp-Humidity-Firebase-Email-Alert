# ESP32 Temperature & Humidity Monitoring with Firebase and Email Alert

Welcome to the ESP32 Temperature and Humidity Monitoring project! This project guides you through setting up real-time climate monitoring using the ESP32 microcontroller, a DHT sensor, Firebase, and Email Alerts, all covered in a comprehensive video tutorial.

## Key Features:

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Keep track of ambient temperature and humidity.
- **Firebase Integration:** Seamlessly store and access data in the cloud.
- **Email Alerts:** Receive notifications when the temperature surpasses a predefined threshold.
- **Arduino Code:** Easy-to-understand code with comments for straightforward implementation.

## Usage:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Upload the Arduino code to your ESP32 board using the Arduino IDE.
3. Configure Firebase and email settings in the code.
4. Monitor real-time data on the Firebase console.
5. Stay informed with email alerts for high temperatures.
